 <h1 style="color: white;">About Josh</h1>
 <p style="color: white;">I am 17, I was born in Detroit, MI on February 7, 1999, Nickname: Josh</p>
<p style="color: white;">I am interested in computers. When I was about 7 I had experienced using my first computer. I had no idea of what I was doing. At that time I was using computers to play games like any other kid. When I grew a little older my cousin got me into designing and creating websites, but we were not using coding. </p>
<p style="color: white;">I am currently learning what coding is and how do to use it. I want to create websites for businesses. I also want to teach kids in my community how to code. I want to show my community that there are other ways to "make it out the hood", you just dont have to play sports.</p>
<p style="color: white;"> I love playing sports. My main sport is basketball, I have been playing basketball since I was 7 years old. I am currently not playing for a high school team, because
 I am switching schools. I play AAU basketball every summer. Next school year I plan on trying out for the schools basketball team. </p>
